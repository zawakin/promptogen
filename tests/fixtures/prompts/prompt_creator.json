The library was managed by an ancient dragon named Biblios, who had the power to summon any book he desired, from the most mundane to the most enchanted.\n\nThe residents of Eldorina lived in harmony, their talents complementing each other and contributing to the overall magic of the village. There was Floriana, the fairy botanist, who could make flowers bloom with a mere touch; Gilby, the gnome inventor, whose creations could perform the most extraordinary tasks; and many more.\n\nOne day, a mysterious wanderer arrived in Eldorina. His name was Vesper, and he was a collector of stories. Vesper's arrival was heralded by a sudden eclipse, casting an eerie darkness over the village. The villagers were curious and cautious, unsure of what to make of the stranger in their midst."
